Hi!

This is an IEEE 802.11a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) communication for image transmission uing MATLAB

The wireless communication part of the project shows how to encode and pack an image file into WLAN packets for transmission 
and subsequently decode the packets to retrieve the image. To facilitate the wireless communictation process we used two ADALM PlutoSDR radios for transmission 
and reception of the waveform.

The following lists are required to design and implement the wireless communicaion part in MATLAB:
1. Communication toolbox
2. ADALM PlutoSDR 
3. Software communication toolbox support package for ADALM PlutoSDR

Please refer the link provided in the "Reference" section about the required hardware and software installation.

Complete system description:                                                                                                                                       
First, the Image is loaded and transmitted from a local computer (comp1) using 802.11a WLN communication on a "1 antenna" plotosdr. And the remote compter receives 
the transmitted image using another "1 antenna" pluto sdr. Once all the transmitted wave packets are received fully, then the MATLAB design reconstract and transmit 
the image to the Raspberry Pi using TCP/IP network connection. Then, the Raspberry Pi performs the image forgery detection and send the result back to the remote 
computer (comp2).

1. From computer 1 to Computer 2 (using 802.11a WLAN)
2. From computer 2 to Raspberry Pi (using TCP/IP socket programming)
3. Perform Image forgery detection on a Raspberry Pi (using Python) 
4. Send the processed image back to computer 2 (using TCP/IP socket programming)

Note: Please refer the README file in the "image processing" folder for the Image forgery detection process (step 3 above). 
Here, we are only discussing the wireless communication part.
                
***************************************
The "Wireless communication" folder contains the transmitter and receiver MATLAB code that was used for this project. 
In addition, inside the Receiver folder there are client and server python codes. These codes are used to create a TCP/IP connection protocol between computer 2 and Raspberry Pi. 


***************************************
Transmitter Design steps:
The general structure of the WLAN transmitter can be described as follows:

1. Import an image from a local computer (comp1) and convert it to binary stream.
2. Scale it down using nearest neighbor algorithm. 
3. Split the data stream into smaller groups
4. Generate Media Access Control (MAC) frame and encode the data bits
5. Generate a baseband WLAN waveform, pack the data stream into multiple 802.11a packets.
6. Prepare the baseband signal for transmission using the PlutoSDR hardware.
7. Send the baseband data to the PlutoSDR hardware for upsampling and continuous transmission at the desired center frequency.


Receiver Design steps:
The general structure of the WLAN receiver can be described as follows:

1. Capture the transmitted wave-packets using another "1 antenna" PlutoSDR 
2. Perform carrier frequency offset estimation and correction
3. Extract the L-LTF and perform channel estimation and correction
4. Extract the L-SIG field to recover the modulation codding scheme (MCS) value and the length of the "Data" portion
5. Extract the data field and perform carrier frequency offset (CFO)
6. Decode the received PSDU and check if the frame check sequence (FCS) passed for the PSDU.
7. Order the decoded MSDUs based on the SequenceNumber property in the recovered MAC frame configuration object.
8. Combine the decoded MSDUs from all the transmitted packets to form the received image

***************************************
USAGE:
1. Download the "Wireless communication" folder or Clone the "wireless-based-image-forgery-detection" folder to your local computer 
2. Connect one plutoSDR with "1 antenna" for the transmitter and receiver computer
3. Use your own image or have one from the "Image" folder with image size "1920 X 1223"
4. Plce it in the same folder with the "Transmiter" folder
5. Run the transmitter "Tx_Rev1.m" MATLAB script 
6. Run the Receiver "Rx_Rev1.m" MATLAB script 
7. The result should display the transmitted waveform, 64QAM constellation, and received image (refer the results displayed below)  
***************************************
TEST RESULT: 
The results shown below are cuptured and processed using MATLAB script.
