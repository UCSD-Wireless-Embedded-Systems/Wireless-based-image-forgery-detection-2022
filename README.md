# Wireless-based-image-forgery-detection
WES 207 - Capstone project. Repository for MATLAB and Python programming for wireless-based image forgery detection using SIFT algorithm

The objectives of this project are to: 
1. Design an 802.11a wireless local area network (WLAN) communication in MATLAB for image transmission. 
2. Design an image forgery detection algorithm in Python and Vitis/Vivado HLS. And,
3. Implement the image processing on a Raspberry Pi and FPGA. 

The below block diagram is showing the system interface block diagram.
